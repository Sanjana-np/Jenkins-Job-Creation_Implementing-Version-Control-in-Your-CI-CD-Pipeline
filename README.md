1.Creating the Jenkins Job

Opened Jenkins and clicked on “New Item”. Created a Freestyle project and named it Newitem. Under the Source Code Management section, selected Git. Entered my GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/sneha-182003/Jenkins-task Changed the branch specification from master to main, since my GitHub repo uses main as the default branch.
